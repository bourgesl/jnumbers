jnumbers library
================

jnumbers is an open-source Java library having a single goal: 
**Faster number parsing and Faster number formatting than Java standard classes**:
   * Short.parseInt(String)
   * Integer.parseInt(String)
   * Long.parseInt(String)
   * Float.parseDouble(String)
   * Double.parseDouble(String)
   * NumberFormat / DecimalFormat classes ...

Note: accuracy of Double/Float parsing is not as good as JDK (1/2 ulp) 
but is correct (and enough for all-purposes) ~ 2 ulps (ie 5e-16 relative error)
