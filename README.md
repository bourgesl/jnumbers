# jnumbers
Java Fast Numbers parsing and formatting as an open source library (Simplified BSD license).

Goals
=====
Faster Parsing and Faster Formatting than Java standard classes like Integer.parseInt(String), Double.parseDouble(String) or NumberFormat / DecimalFormat classes

Note: accuracy with Double/Float is not as good as JDK (1/2 ulp) but is correct ~ 2 ulps (ie 5e-16 relative error)
